ForceFlow - A website for Data Scientists and Quants - A Django Project 

## Description

A website where quants and data scientists can share their projects. This site can also be used as your personal website with all your projects displayed. This was a project I took on because I wanted to create something using the Django framework. Please feel free to use the code repository to build your very own website or personal webpage with projects.
